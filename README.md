This is a multiple choice trivia quiz with a countdown timer.

One question is displayed at a time with three answers to choose from by clicking on their corresponding radio buttons.

The timer starts up at 30 seconds when a new question is displayed. 

If the user selects an answer before the timer reaches 0, their answer is compared with the correct answer. Feedback and the correct answer are displayed for three seconds.

If the user does not answer in time, a message acknowledging that and the correct answer are displayed for three seconds.

The game ends when all of the questions have been answered. 

The number of correct answers and the total number of questions asked get displayed at the end of the game for 3 seconds. Then the display gets reset to its initial state, thus enabling the user to restart the game.
